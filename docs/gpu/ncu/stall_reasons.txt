Stall Reasons
- Stall Long Scoreboard: Warp was stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency on a L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture) operation.
- Stall LG Throttle: Warp was stalled waiting for the L1 instruction queue for local and global (LG) memory operations to be not full.
- Stall MIO Throttle: Warp was stalled waiting for the MIO (memory input/output) instruction queue to be not full.
- Stall Wait: Warp was stalled waiting on a fixed latency execution dependency.
- Stall Not Selected: Warp was stalled waiting for the micro scheduler to select the warp to issue.
- Stall Barrier: Warp was stalled waiting for sibling warps at a CTA barrier.
- Stall Selected: Warp was selected by the micro scheduler and issued an instruction.
- Stall Math Pipe Throttle: Warp was stalled waiting for the execution pipe to be available.
- Stall Short Scoreboard: Warp was stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency on a MIO (memory input/output) operation (not to L1TEX).
- Stall Dispatch Stall: Warp was stalled waiting on a dispatch stall.
- Stall IMC Miss: Warp was stalled waiting for an immediate constant cache (IMC) miss.
- Stall No Instruction: Warp was stalled waiting to be selected to fetch an instruction or waiting on an instruction cache miss.
- Stall Misc: Warp was stalled for a miscellaneous hardware reason.
- Stall Branch Resolving: Warp was stalled waiting for a branch target to be computed, and the warp program counter to be updated.
- Stall Drain: Warp was stalled after EXIT waiting for all outstanding memory operations to complete so that warp's resources can be freed.
- Stall Tex Throttle: Warp was stalled waiting for the L1 instruction queue for texture operations to be not full.
